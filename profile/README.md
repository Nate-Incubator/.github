# Nate's Incubator

All of these projects are personally approved by Nate. Nate takes 100% responsibility for all projects that come out of this organization.

```
Let me explain something to you. Your whole life you've been an ugly chick but now suddenly you're a hot chick,
with big t*ts and small nxpples. So guys like that are gonna keep coming around. Don't be a slut, Richard.
```


## Rules of the Org:

1. Only projects of the utmost quality and vision will be accepted to the Nate Incubator
2. Projects with excessive dependencies will be frowned upon
3. [Arch](https://archlinux.org) is the best operating system read about it on my [blog](https://github.com/npmaile/blog/blob/main/posts/2.%20How%20to%20get%20into%20software.md)
4. The official stance of this Organization is that the United States is the best.
5. Because of rule #1 Nate is unable to participate, so the foundation was created in his absence.
